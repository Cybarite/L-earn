# 7 (Count 'em) Habits of Highly Effective people

It comes up now and then

1. Be Proactive
1. Begin with the End in Mind
1. Put First Things First
1. Think Win/Win
1. Seek First to Understand, Then to Be Understood
1. Synergize
1. Sharpen the Saw

The reason for adding it was to show that for the ordered list, prefix the list item with 1. instead of trying to count them yourself.

    1. This is one
    2. This is two
    4. This is four

gives:

1. This is one
2. This is two
4. This is four
